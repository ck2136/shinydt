The goal of shinydt is to provide a simple web application framework for
those who want to view their data (in the form of a csv file) and do
basic search/filtering

## Installation

Given the limited usefulness of the shiny application, you aren’t going
to find the package in [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org). However you
could install it with with `devtools`:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ck2136/shinydt")
```

## Use

In order to run the application run the following code:

``` r
library(shinydt)
# run_app()
```
